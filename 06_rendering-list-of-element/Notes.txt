//                               Summary Note

// Note-1: while we write command in package.json "scripts: there is no need to write "npx:, we use parcel index.html only , when we run this command
//         i.e 'start' named command no need to us 'run' instead npm start works well

// Note-2: We not pass multiple element in the render function by comma separated instead we allow to pass an array of element but it through an
//         error that each element in the array sibling have unique

// Note-3: SO , for Rendering a multiple elements in react Pass a array of react element to the render function and it make sure rendering 
//         properly 

// Note-4: Here when we render multiple react element by just passing array into render method , but here one problem is that while we pass all the 
//         card info to the Card() function must maintain the order of passing the argument for eg. title , image etc. we see the solution of 
//         this in React Component
