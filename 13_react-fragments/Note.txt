//                                   <<<<<  React Fragments  >>>>>>

// Note-1: In React, whenever a component returns more than one element, 
//         it throws an error saying "JSX expressions must have one parent element". 
//         To avoid this, React provides the <Fragment> component (or shorthand <> </>), 
//         which acts as a wrapper to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.
//         In other words, React Fragments let us return multiple elements without introducing 
//         unnecessary wrapper elements in the rendered HTML.

// Note-2: when we console.log(Fragment) it give -->> Symbol(react.fragment)
//         and console.log(typeof Fragment) it give --> symbol
///        and console.log(<Fragment></Fragment>) it give --> React element which have type Symbol(react.fragment)
