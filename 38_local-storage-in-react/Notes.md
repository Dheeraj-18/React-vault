# Local storage in React using Custom Hook -  useLocalStorage()

## Summary Notes

#### Concept Objective:– To implement localStorage in React, we create a custom hook called `useLocalStorage()`, and its working is similar to `useState()`. Wherever we normally use `useState()`, we instead use `useLocalStorage()`, passing a key and initial data, and it returns both the stored data and an update function. This way, we design the custom hook so that it stores the value in localStorage while also behaving like a regular state variable, making it an amazing, robust, and reusable custom hook.
