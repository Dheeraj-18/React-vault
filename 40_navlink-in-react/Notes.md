# NavLink in react js 

### **Concept Objective**

- We use routing with **NavLink** to highlight the active page.  
  The main objective is:

 - **Whenever the user navigates to Home, About, or any other page, the active link should be automatically highlighted so the user knows which page they are currently on.**
